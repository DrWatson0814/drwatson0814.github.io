          <h3>Asst. Manager - Charter Foods LLC</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>July 2017 to May 2023</p>
          <p>
            After becoming the highest paid hourly employee in the company, I
            was made assistant manager for the final two years of my employment.
            While there I aided with managing as many as 15 employees at one
            time, and was responsible for monitoring financial integrity, the
            management of inventory, and issues dealing with the public.

          <p>
            I prepared food in a fast paced and stressful
            environment. I staged, cooked, and plated different dishes, maintaining 
            order accuracy across multiply tables. I know what it means to be under
            pressure and still must perform to a high standard. I also handled 
            dealing with all problems that may have arose during my shift.

          <p>
            I managed a team entrusted with overseeing the flow of hundreds of
            thousands of dollars in general merchandise from its delivery to the
            sales floor. This included ensuring the proper use and maintenance
            of the inventory system. Proficiency in the S.M.A.R.T. inventory
            control system was required, as were personnel management skills.

          <h3>Capstone Project</h3>
          <p>Completed 2025</p>
          <p>
            Created an online portfolio, featuring a responsive design, and I utilized HTML, CSS, and Git during this
            project. As this was a solo project, I created, designed, and coded
            this project myself.

          <h3>Bathroom Remodel</h3>
          <p>Completed 2024</p>
          <p>
            The project required the complete refinish of the walls and ceiling,
            the removal of the tub, sink, vanity, tile floor, and toilet. The
            ceiling was raised five inches to accommodate the new shower and
            bathtub. This required skills in math, knowledge of building codes,
            structural engineering, various construction techniques, and time
            management. The project took a total of eight days. Since the home
            was occupied, public relations were also required. This was a solo
            project, so all tasks and problems fell to me.
